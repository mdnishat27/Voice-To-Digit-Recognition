# Voice To Digit Recognition

It is a python program for voice to digit recognition. It can recognize digit from a prerecorded audio of spoken digit.

Python libraries - librosa, numpy, sklearn, tensorflow, keras etc. are used in this program


We collect the audio dataset from here https://github.com/Jakobovski/free-spoken-digit-dataset

For training and testing we use 3000 pre-recorded audio files with label. We use 80% data as training set and 20% data as test set. We got 94% accuracy in 'voice2digit94.h5' model.
